# Requirements

You'll have to have installed the Haskell build tool [stack](https://haskellstack.org)

# Prepare your project

Begin by depending on the `inliterate` package. You can add this in your `build-depends` field in the
***.cabal** file of your project, or in the `dependencies` field in your **package.yaml** file.

Write into `doc/*.md`.
